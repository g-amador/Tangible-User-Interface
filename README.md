# Tangible-User-Interface
Tangible User Interface (TUI) - formerly touchAll - is an Flash as3 framework, that supports all-in-one multi-touch, gestures, and fiducials, either through UDP, TCP, or Flash Local Connection, built on top of:

TUI is intended to reduce conde redundancy in TUIO-as3 library and serve as a framework that allows quick development of applications, with multi-touch, gestures, and fiducials, either through UDP, TCP, or Local Connection.

TUI was first presented as a MUE 2011 conference article, available for download at:

You are free to use and modify TUI as you see fit: to create your own multitouch apps, to extend it, and to port it to another programming language. 
You cannot take the credit for making TUI/TouchAll! 
Please inform me if you either extend TUI, create more apps with TUI, or port it to another programming languange.

If you have any questions, feel free to e-mail me at [gmail](mailto://g.n.p.amador@gmail.com) and ask away.

Good luck!
