\begin{itemize}
\begin{minipage}{.9\linewidth} 
%\item Previous solutions using a bridge took more time due to TCP to UDP datagram conversion.
\item The time required in developing applications for multi-touch devices can be shortened using TUI.\\
\item TUI allows to use fiducials and multi-touch through UDP, TCP, flash LocalConnection all in once. \\
\item ActionbScript-based non-free software alternatives exist, but not with native fiducial support.

\begin{block}{Future work}
\begin{itemize}
\begin{minipage}{.9\linewidth} 
\item Development of tools that allow device emulation, for multi-touch, multi-mouse pointer, and platform independent application testing.\\
\item Include in the TUI more native widgets for specific fiducials.\\
\item Include in the TUI support for 3D object loading and gesture based manipulation.\\
\item Integrate the TUI as a module of an 2D/3D ActionScript 3.0 game engine.
